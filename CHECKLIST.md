# Development Checklist for Location Tracking App

This checklist is ordered from most important to least important steps in order to guide the development of a React Native app with Expo for real-time user location tracking, admin map view, and group chat capabilities.

## Critical Setup
- [X] **Set up Expo project**
  - Initialize a new Expo project using `npx create-expo-app`.
  - Install core dependencies: `react-native-maps`, `expo-location`, `expo-linking`, and Firebase SDK (`firebase`).
- [ ] **Configure Firebase project**
  - Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
  - Enable Authentication (email/password or phone), Firestore, and Cloud Functions.
  - Add your app’s Firebase config to the Expo project.
- [ ] **Define Firestore schema**
  - Create collections: `users` (user profiles with name, phone, role), `locations` (real-time user coordinates), `work_logs` (start/stop events with timestamps and locations).
  - Set up basic security rules to restrict access (e.g., only users can write their location, admins can read all locations).

## Core Features
- [ ] **Implement user authentication**
  - Use Firebase Authentication for user and admin registration/login (email/password or phone-based).
  - Store user role (admin/user) in Firestore under `users/{userId}`.
- [ ] **Build location sharing functionality**
  - Use `expo-location` to request foreground location permissions and share user location every 10-30 seconds during work hours.
  - Update user’s coordinates and timestamp in Firestore’s `locations` collection.
  - Log start/stop events in `work_logs` with timestamps and locations.
- [ ] **Create admin map view**
  - Use `react-native-maps` to display a live map with user markers.
  - Implement Firestore real-time listeners to update markers based on `locations` collection.
  - Add marker click handler to show user details and trigger `tel:` URI via `expo-linking` for phone calls.
- [ ] **Test location sharing and map accuracy**
  - Verify location updates are accurate and frequent enough (e.g., every 10-30 seconds).
  - Test battery usage on iOS and Android devices to ensure minimal drain.
  - Confirm admin map updates in real-time and phone call integration works.

## Security and Optimization
- [ ] **Refine Firestore security rules**
  - Ensure users can only write to their own `locations` and `work_logs`.
  - Allow admins to read all `locations` and `users` but not write to other users’ data.
  - Test rules with Firebase’s emulator suite.
- [ ] **Optimize location updates**
  - Use geohashing (e.g., `ngeohash` library) to efficiently query nearby users.
  - Limit location update frequency to balance accuracy and battery/database usage.
  - Enable Firestore’s offline support to reduce unnecessary queries.

## Polish and Deployment
- [ ] **Add push notifications**
  - Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) with `expo-notifications` to remind users to start/stop location sharing.
  - Test notifications on iOS and Android.
- [ ] **Set up analytics and monitoring**
  - Integrate Firebase Analytics to track user engagement (e.g., location sharing frequency).
  - Add Firebase Crashlytics to monitor crashes and errors.
- [ ] **Deploy the app**
  - Use Expo Application Services (EAS) to build and submit the app to Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
  - Test over-the-air updates for bug fixes.
- [ ] **Monitor Firebase usage**
  - Set budget alerts in Firebase to track reads/writes and prevent unexpected costs.
  - Optimize queries to reduce database usage (e.g., index frequently queried fields).

## Future Features
- [ ] **Plan group chat integration**
  - Design Firestore schema for group chats (e.g., `groups/{groupId}` with member IDs and `messages` subcollection).
  - Prototype a basic chat UI with real-time message sync using Firestore listeners.
- [ ] **Explore advanced chat services**
  - Evaluate Stream Chat or Sendbird for polished chat UI and features (e.g., typing indicators, read receipts).
  - Compare integration effort and cost against building with Firestore.
- [ ] **Add admin portal (optional)**
  - Consider a web-based admin portal using Firebase Hosting and React for easier map access on desktop.
  - Reuse existing Firestore data and authentication.
